# Mission to Mars

## Built a "Latest Hits" site that pulls the latest new article from NASA and come cool images!

Extract information from active websites
Use Chrome developer tools to identify HTML components attached to the data we want
Use BeautifulSoup & Splinter to automate a web browser and gather the data we’ve identified
Mongo (a no-SQL database) is what we will use to store the data
Then to display it, we’ll create a web application using Flask

## Challlenge: Add Hemispheres Images and Captions, and of course, make it pretty :grin:
